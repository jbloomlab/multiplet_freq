# Estimating the frequency of multiplets in single-cell RNA sequencing from cell-mixing experiments

This repository contains the code and text for a short paper by [Jesse Bloom](https://research.fhcrc.org/bloom/en.html) that describes how to calculate the multiplet frequency from single-cell RNA sequencing experiments where two cell types are mixed in arbitrary proportions.

The paper is published in _PeerJ_ at [6:e5578](https://peerj.com/articles/5578/).

The LaTex source for the paper is in [paper.tex](paper.tex), and the compiled PDF is in [paper.pdf](paper.pdf).

A Jupyter notebook that contains a Python function that perform the calculation is in [calcmultiplet.ipynb](calcmultiplet.ipynb). 
A notebook with a R function is in [calcmultiplet_R.ipynb](calcmultiplet_R.ipynb).

You can run the notebook and compile the paper by running the script [compile.bash](compile.bash).
