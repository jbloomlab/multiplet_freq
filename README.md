# Estimating the frequency of multiplets in single-cell RNA sequencing from cell-mixing experiments

This repository contains the code and text for a short paper by [Jesse Bloom](https://research.fhcrc.org/bloom/en.html) that describes how to calculate the multiplet frequency from single-cell RNA sequencing experiments where two cell types are mixed in arbitrary proportions.

The LaTex source for the paper is in [paper.tex](paper.tex), and the compiled PDF is in [paper.pdf](paper.pdf).

A Jupyter notebook that contains Python and R functions that perform the calculation, and that contains example calculations, is in [calcmultiplet.ipynb](calcmultiplet.ipynb).

You can run the notebook and compile the paper by running the script [compile.bash](compile.bash).
